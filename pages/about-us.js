            <p>Since its inception in 2013, the Hobe Rwanda Festival has become a much-loved fixture on Kigali’s cultural calendar.
                With a keen focus on Rwandan culture, Hobe promotes local musicians, artists and dancers with a two-day fest that usually takes place in September.
                International artists are represented here too,
                but if it’s a slice of real-life Rwandan creativity you want, Hobe is the place to be.
